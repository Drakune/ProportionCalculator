## Description
Somewhat of a crappy description, but i tried to describe it as good as i could.

This program calculates the proportions with given ingredients. Afterwards you can divide all numbers by a certain dividend, if you wish. When you set the values, by clicking on plus or minus, you can increase or decrease the numbers by the values you have set. Thus, each recipe is always given exactly according to the correct percentage. One divides only if one gave recipes, which begin for example only with completely large numbers. For example one has 200 gram eggs and 150 gram flour, would like however not in 200 gram steps, but in 20 gram steps. Then one divides by 10, sets the values and adds all other values up with. Then you jump in 20 gram egg steps and in 15 gram flour steps.
